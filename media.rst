Media
======

Here are some notes and instructions for accessing the Inkpebble media
resources (video and audio). Check the #mediastuffs channel on slack for
more info and to communicate with the rest of the media team.

Accessing the media folder:

1. Download and install Bittorrent Sync (http://www.bittorrent.com/sync)
2. In the Bittorrent Sync setup, select the option for having a shared code
3. Ask in #mediastuffs for the folder code
4. Select the folder you want the media to sync to
5. Start using it!

The awesome part about this is that we're only limited by the space of
our harddrives, and don't have to pay another provider for space.
