Channels
--------

Anyone can create any channel or private group they wish, but there are some common ones worth knowing about:

* #general: Discussion for the good of the whole group
* #random: The gifs that keep on giving. All the random crap you can think of.
* #bot-announce: A channel devoted to automatic notifications that don't make sense in other channels. Git, heroku, travis notifications go here for now
* #engineering: Anything techy. Designed to keep tech discussions out of #general
* #inkpebble: The business of the the business. Things that directly relate to Captain Quail or Inkpebble. No funny business, please.
* #mediastuffs: Discussion about videos, podcasts, etc, around Inkpebble
* #vent: A place to rant, rave, complain, swear, and generally get things off your chest. No judging, no trying to fix problems. Just ranting.

Other channels are hopefully self-explanatory.
